    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Noodles are the traditional noodles of Asian cuisine: but unlike the pasta we eat in Europe that is mostly made with wheat flour, noodles can be made with different types of flour. Certainly rice noodles are the ones that sound the most to us Westerners, but there are also wheat like yakisoba and ramen, or buckwheat, soba. There are even those without any flour like shirataki, which are made with a fiber that is obtained from a plant called konjac.</p>

    <p>Noodles can also have different forms: the udon are made of wheat, and are long and thick; the rice shahe fen are typical of Cantonese food and are somewhat thick, unlike those used for the Thai pad, which are made of rice but finer.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>250g prawns (or peeled prawns)</li>
    <li>125g of noodles</li>
    <li>1 red pepper</li>
    <li>2 shallots</li>
    <li>1 lime</li>
    <li>a handful of peanuts</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li> 



    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>Wash the shallots and pepper and cut them into thin strips. Clean the prawns if they are not already clean. We grind the peanuts a little, that they are not very ground, and we toast them a few minutes in a pan.</p> 

    <p>Put to heat a pot with water to cook the noodles. In a wok or large skillet heat the oil, and when hot sauté the prawns a few minutes, until ready. Remove and in the same oil incorporate the vegetables, sauté 3-4 minutes with the strong fire, add the soy sauce, stir and saute until the vegetables are al dente.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile we cook rice noodles according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
    
    <p>Drain the noodles and add them directly to the wok, add the prawns and let the flavors integrate for 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve with toasted peanuts on top and cut lime.</p>
